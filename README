Net2PCAP is a simple network to pcap capture file for Linux. Its goal
is to be as simple as possible (hence auditable) so that good
confidence can be reached, for it to be used in hostile
environments.

It does not use any library except a bit of libc. It does not do
anything except dumping network traffic from an interface to a pcap
file. It is less than 400 lines of C. Please audit it !

Comparison with tcpdump

  * Yes, tcpdump -w capfile can do almost the same. But the goal of
    tcpdump is network debugging (thus, lot of options, packet
    disassembly, etc.). The goal of net2pcap is to capture traffic into
    a file in hostile environments (honeypots, internet, etc.) for
    future analysis.
  * net2pcap can run in daemon mode
  * net2pcap can reopen its capture file (SIGHUP) (used for capture file rotation)
  * net2pcap does not do anything else than reading from network and dumping to file
  * net2pcap does not use libpcap
  * net2pcap runs only on Linux
  * net2pcap is auditable (less than 400 lines)
